problem 1:

50 = 6 * 5 + 20
51 = 6 * 7 + 9
52 = 6 * 2 + 20 * 2
53 = 6 * 4 + 9 + 20
54 = 6 * 9
55 = 6 + 9 + 20 * 2

problem 2:
assume all the number can be presented in McNuggets pack are in Set(Nc).
set: x = 50
for any number N >= x:
set: t = (N - x) % 6 , so t is in (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
set: p = (N - x - t) / 6, we can indicate that p is non negative integer(remaining is t).
so N = p * 6 + (x + t)
and (x + t) is in Set(Nc) and p * 6 is in Set(Nc).
so N is in Set(Nc).
Theorem proved.
