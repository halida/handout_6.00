problem 1:

50 = 6 * 5 + 20
51 = 6 * 7 + 9
52 = 6 * 2 + 20 * 2
53 = 6 * 4 + 9 + 20
54 = 6 * 9
55 = 6 + 9 + 20 * 2

problem 2:
assume all the number can be presented in McNuggets pack are in Set(Nc).
for any number N >= x:
t = (N - x) % 6
p = (N - x - t) / 6, p is positive integer.
and N = p * 6 + (x + t)
t is in (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
so (x + t) is in Set(Nc)
and N = 6 * p + (x + t), so N is in Set(Nc).
Theorem proved.
